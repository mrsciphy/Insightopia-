Project Proposal
The overview and the objective of the project:
	A dataset of manufacturing line productivity of drinks needs to be cleaned and analysed to extract insights in order to achieve the following objective: “addressing the most downtime factors affecting the productivity in August and September 2024 in order to reduce manufacturing downtime by 20% at least”.
To reach this objective we need to answer the following questions through the project:
•	How does batch processing time compare to the minimum batch time for each product?
•	What are the most common downtime factors?
•	What is the total production time per operator?
•	Which operators have the highest and lowest downtime incidents?
•	What is the overall efficiency of the manufacturing line (productive time vs. downtime)?
The scope of the project:
•	In-scope: 
o	clean, preprocess and build a data model for the dataset.
o	Determine all the possible analysis and forecast questions to be answered.
o	Analyse the downtime keys/factors and predict the downtime in the next period.
o	Highlight the number of batches to be produced after predicting the downtime.
o	Build a dashboard to visualize the answers of the questions. 
o	Prepare a report summarizing the work of the project.
•	Out-of-scope: 
o	Real time monitoring the system of manufacturing.
o	Changes the workflow or scheduling of production.
•	Roles of Data analyst Team members:
o	The leader: Mohamed Abdelghaffar.
o	Data governors: 
	Mohamed Abdelghaffar: 
•	Follow up the procedures of the project plan.
•	Preprocess the dataset and prepare the analysis questions. 
	Madonna Wadeaa):
•	Clean the data and handle the missing or null value in the dataset.
•	Answer the analysis questions using SQL.
o	Data storyteller: 
	Yasser Mabrouk:
•	Answer the analysis questions using Python.
•	Prepare the dashboard using PowerBi.
	Saif Tarek: 
•	Answer the analysis questions using Python.
•	prepare the forecasting questions
•	Deliverables: 
o	Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
o	Preprocessing notebook.
o	Set of analysis and forecasting questions.
o	Visualization dashboard for answering the questions.
o	Final report and presentation.
