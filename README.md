#Manufacturing Downtime Analysis
##Overview & Objective
   This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset related to the productivity of a drinks manufacturing line. The primary goal is to **identify and address the key downtime factors affecting productivity in August and September 2024, with the aim of reducing manufacturing downtime by at least 20%**.\
To achieve this objective, we will explore the following:

How does batch processing time compare to the minimum batch time for each product?
- What are the most common downtime factors?
- What is the total production time per operator?
- Which operators have the highest and lowest downtime incidents?
- What is the overall efficiency of the manufacturing line (productive time vs. downtime)?\
