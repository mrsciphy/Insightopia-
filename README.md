# Manufacturing Downtime Analysis
## Overview & Objective
   This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset related to the productivity of a drinks manufacturing line. The primary goal is to **identify and address the key downtime factors affecting productivity in August and September 2024, with the aim of reducing manufacturing downtime by at least 20%**.\
To achieve this objective, we will explore the following:

- How does batch processing time compare to the minimum batch time for each product?
- What are the most common downtime factors?
- What is the total production time per operator?
- Which operators have the highest and lowest downtime incidents?
- What is the overall efficiency of the manufacturing line (productive time vs. downtime)?\

## The scope of the project:
### In-scope: 
+ clean, preprocess and build a data model for the dataset.
+ Determine all the possible analysis and forecast questions to be answered.
+ Analyse the downtime keys/factors and predict the downtime in the next period.
+ Highlight the number of batches to be produced after predicting the downtime.
+ Build a dashboard to visualize the answers of the questions. 
+ Prepare a report summarizing the work of the project.
### Out-of-scope: 
+ Real time monitoring the system of manufacturing.
+ Changes the workflow or scheduling of production.
### Roles of Data analyst Team members:
+ The leader: Mohamed Abdelghaffar.
+ Data governors:

# Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan
Potential risks that could impact on the success of the analysis and its implementation:\
a)	Data collection issues:
•	Risk: incomplete data or too many missing values in the dataset.
•	Impact: poor analysis leading to incorrect downtime cause identification.
•	Mitigation: validate, clean and preprocess the data before the analysis.
b)	Analysis challenges:
•	Risk: incorrect statistical and data model leading to misleading conclusions. 
•	Impact: ineffective decision making and wasted time.
•	Mitigation: use multiple analysis tools (SQL, python, Power BI) and continuously refine models with the instructor reflection. 
c)	Lack of actionable insights:
•	Risk: analysis results are too complex or do not translate into clear improvements.
•	Impact: difficulty in implementing recommendations leading to no improvements in downtime
•	Mitigation: present the findings in a clear visual dashboard (e.g. charts) and provide actionable recommendations.
d)	Lack of meeting time:
•	Risk: team members have their work hours or it’s hard to agree on specific time for all members.
•	Impact: delay in following the project plan procedures leading to poor willingness to work.
•	Mitigation: schedule online meetings via MS. Teams and send the instructions on WhatsApp group of the team.
