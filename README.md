# Manufacturing Downtime Analysis
## Overview & Objective
   This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset related to the productivity of a drinks manufacturing line. The primary goal is to **identify and address the key downtime factors affecting productivity in August and September 2024, with the aim of reducing manufacturing downtime by at least 20%**.\
To achieve this objective, we will explore the following:

- How does batch processing time compare to the minimum batch time for each product?
- What are the most common downtime factors?
- What is the total production time per operator?
- Which operators have the highest and lowest downtime incidents?
- What is the overall efficiency of the manufacturing line (productive time vs. downtime)?\
## Team Members:
* Mohamed Abdelghaffar (Team Lead)
* Madonna Wadeaa
* Yasser Mabrouk
* Saif Tarek
## The scope of the project:
### In-scope: 
+ clean, preprocess and build a data model for the dataset.
+ Determine all the possible analysis and forecast questions to be answered.
+ Analyse the downtime keys/factors and predict the downtime in the next period.
+ Highlight the number of batches to be produced after predicting the downtime.
+ Build a dashboard to visualize the answers of the questions. 
+ Prepare a report summarizing the work of the project.
### Out-of-scope: 
+ Real time monitoring the system of manufacturing.
+ Changes the workflow or scheduling of production.
### Roles of Data analyst Team members:
+ The leader: Mohamed Abdelghaffar.
