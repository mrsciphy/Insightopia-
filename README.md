The overview and the objective of the project:
	A dataset of manufacturing line productivity of drinks needs to be cleaned and analysed to extract insights in order to achieve the following objective: “addressing the most downtime factors affecting the productivity in August and September 2024 in order to reduce manufacturing downtime by 20% at least”.
To reach this objective we need to answer the following questions through the project:
•	How does batch processing time compare to the minimum batch time for each product?
•	What are the most common downtime factors?
•	What is the total production time per operator?
•	Which operators have the highest and lowest downtime incidents?
•	What is the overall efficiency of the manufacturing line (productive time vs. downtime)?
